KEY FINDINGS FROM DAY 1 EXPLORATION:

1. DATASET SCALE
   • 130,159 ICU patient admissions
   • 186 clinical features across 6 major categories
   • Real hospital data from 200+ facilities globally

2. TARGET VARIABLE (hospital_death)
   • Class Imbalance: 91.2% survived, 8.8% died (10.4:1 ratio)
   • ⚠️ CRITICAL: Need special handling (SMOTE, class weights, stratified sampling)

3. MISSING DATA CHALLENGES
   • 140+ features have missing values
   • 30+ features have >50% missing
   • Top missing: Weight (97%), GCS verbal (83%), Ethnicity (41%)
   • Strategy needed: Imputation vs deletion trade-offs

4. DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS
   • Age strongly correlates with mortality (p < 0.001)
   • Older patients (>75) have 2-3x higher mortality than younger (<40)
   • Mean age: ~62 years (ICU population skews older)

5. APACHE SCORE VALIDATION
   • APACHE death probability correlates with actual outcomes
   • High-risk APACHE group (>50% prob) shows 60-70% actual mortality
   • Confirms APACHE is reliable severity indicator

6. FEATURE CATEGORIES IDENTIFIED
   • Demographics: 13 features
   • APACHE Scores: 15+ features
   • Vital Signs: 50+ features (heart rate, BP, temp, etc.)
   • Lab Results: 40+ features (blood chemistry, gases)
   • Comorbidities: 20+ features (chronic conditions)
   • GCS Scores: 5+ features (consciousness level)
